# Edge Detection Using Convolutional Kernels



---

## Introduction

I employed convolution operations using different kernels including:
- **Sobel**
- **Scharr**
- **Feldman**

Each of these kernels emphasizes changes in intensity in either the horizontal or vertical directions.

---

## Method

### 1. Image Preprocessing

- Grayscale conversion of input image (to simplify the intensity detection).

### 2. Kernel Definitions

I defined kernels for horizontal and vertical edge detection for each operator.

- **Sobel**:
  ```python
  sobel_x = np.array([[-1, 0, 1], 
                        [-2, 0, 2], 
                        [-1, 0, 1]])
  sobel_y = np.array([[1, 2, 1], 
                      [0, 0, 0], 
                      [-1, -2, -1]])
  ```

- **Scharr**:
  ```python
  scharr_x = np.array([[-3, 0, 3], 
                        [-10, 0, 10], 
                        [-3, 0, 3]])
  scharr_y = np.array([[3, 10, 3], 
                        [0, 0, 0], 
                        [-3, -10, -3]])
  ```

- **Feldman**:
  ```python
  feldman_x = np.array([[-1, 0, 1], 
                        [-1, 0, 1], 
                        [-1, 0, 1]])
  feldman_y = np.array([[1, 1, 1], 
                        [0, 0, 0], 
                        [-1, -1, -1]])
  ```

### 3. Convolution Implementation

I implemented a convolution function from scratch using nested loops and applied each kernel to the input image. For each method:
- Convolve with X and Y kernels
- Combine results using the magnitude:  
  
  Edge Magnitude= sqrt{G_x^2 + G_y^2}

  When I tried to combine them the first time there was a weird image that came due to overflow of values when it was in uint8 type so I switched the type to float32 and then found edge magnitude.

## Results and Comparisons

### Visual Comparisons

Images were generated for each kernel's X and Y edge detection as well as the combined edge magnitude. These visual outputs show the differences in sensitivity and sharpness of the edge detection:

| Operator | Horizontal | Vertical | Combined |
|----------|------------|----------|----------|
| Sobel    | ![sobel_x](sobelhor.png) | ![sobel_y](sobelvert.png) | ![sobel_combined](sobelcomb.png) |
| Scharr   | ![scharr_x](scharrhor.png) | ![scharr_y](scharrvert.png) | ![scharr_combined](scharrcomb.png) |
| Feldman  | ![feldman_x](feldhor.png) | ![feldman_y](feldvert.png) | ![feldman_combined](feldcomb.png) |

### Observations

- Sobel produced sharper edges, especially useful for fine details.
- Scharr provided decent overall edge detection but was very fuzzy.
- Feldman was similar to sobel but a bit less sharp.

---

## Conclusion

All three kernels achieved the objective of detecting image edges. The Sobel operator performed best in terms of clarity, followed by Feldman and then Scharr.
